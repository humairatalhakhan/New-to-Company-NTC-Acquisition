## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Business Understanding
- The Manager requested a dashboard to monitor **Corporates onboarded in the last three months**.  
- KPIs to be tracked:
  - **New-to-Company Acquisition per RM** (budget = 32 per RM)  
  - **Card Issuance per RM** (budget = 750 cards)  
  - **Salary Transfer %** of employees (target = 80%)  
- Goal: Provide clear, visual insights into performance against set budgets/targets.  

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Data Understanding
- **Data Source:** Simulated dataset (to protect confidentiality of real bank data).  
- **Data Features:**
  - Corporate ID / Name (anonymized)  
  - Onboarding Date  
  - RM (Relationship Manager)
  - No. of Cards Issued  
  - Salary Transfer %  
- **Data Volume:** Last 3 months onboarding records.

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Approach (Data Analysis Life Cycle)
- **Data Collection:** Used sample Excel data representing corporates onboarded.  
- **Data Preparation:**  
  - Cleaned and validated onboarding dates.  
  - Applied lookup formulas (VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP) to align KPIs.  
  - Standardized corporate and RM-level records.  
- **Data Analysis:**  
  - Calculated KPIs (NTC acquisition per RM, card issuance per RM, salary transfer %).  
  - Compared actual performance vs budgeted targets.  
- **Data Visualization:**  
  - Built an interactive Excel dashboard.  
  - First chart: A donut chart displaying Total Acquisition vs Budget, with the percentage achieved prominently shown in the center for quick insights.

  - Secong chart: A combination chart showing regional achievements for AUH, SHJ, and DXB.
  - Clustered bars represent budget vs actual acquisition for each region.
  - A line overlay indicates the percentage of budget achieved, providing a clear comparison of performance across regions.

- **Insights:**  
  - Highlighted performance gaps against targets at both overall and regional levels.
  - Added RM-level tracking with bar charts showing target vs achieved for each region, enabling better accountability and performance monitoring by Relationship Manager.
